### Project's Description
Coffee House is a landing page consisting of two pages, responsive and with interactive elements, implemented according to PerfectPixel based on a Figma design

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```console
git clone https://github.com/anthony-th/hangman.git
```
2. Install the NPM packages in the project folder:
```console
npm install
```

## This project was implemented according to the criteria and rules outlined below:

### Project Work Stages
The task consists of three parts:

- `Coffee-House. Part-1: Fixed Layout`
    - In this part of the task, you need to create the 'Home' and 'Menu' pages based on the layout, which should display correctly when the window width is at least 1440px;
    - The validity of the work is checked, as well as its compliance with the layout.
- `Coffee-House. Part-2: Responsive Design`
    - In this part of the task, it is necessary to add responsiveness to the pages created in the first stage, up to and including a width of 380px;
    - The validity of the work is checked, its alignment with the layout at the corresponding page width, layout responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scroll bars.
- `Coffee-House. Part-3: Adding Functionality`
    - In this part of the task, we use JavaScript to add interactivity to the pages;
    - The implemented functionality is being checked.

The duration of each part of the task is `1 week`.
The form of evaluation for each part of the task is a cross-check review.

[Design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SAoBmuOqTfguehdT4IFRxQ/Coffee-House?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=qis81E9Ovgx47eVl-0)

### Technical requirements
1. The layout is valid, semantic, and matches the design.
2. The application is displayed correctly and functions properly in the latest version of Google Chrome.
3. Using CSS frameworks (e.g., `Bootstrap`) is not allowed.
4. Using JS frameworks (e.g., `Angula`, `React`, `Vue`, etc.) is not allowed.
5. Using outdated libraries (e.g. `JQuery`, etc.) or pre-built libraries (e.g. `Swiper`, etc) to implement functionality is not allowed.
6. Using `TypeScript` is not allowed.
7. Using CSS preprocessors (`SASS`, `SCSS`), `normalize.css` is allowed.
8. Using a style reset with `reset.css` is not recommended.
9. Adding layout as an image by taking a screenshot of a part of the layout and pasting it into the markup is not allowed. Please use tags and characters for layout, and use images only for adding pictures and icons, not for layout elements (buttons, blocks, sections).
10. The code must be readable, without minification or obfuscation. You are allowed to use bundlers, such as `Vite` or `Webpack`, but enable `source maps`. Gulp is unmaintained and should not be used.
